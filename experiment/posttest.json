      "question": "Which is the most commonly used in-situ test for shear strength determination?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Borehole shear test",
        "b": "Vane shear test",
        "c": "Both a and b",
        "d": "Neither a nor b"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Borehole shear in-situ test, which needs drilled boring and uses   plates that load the side boring.",
        "b": "Vane shear test is the most commonly used in-situ test and also in laboratory.",
        "c": "The most commonly used in-situ test is vane shear. Hence the answer can not be both a and b.",
        "d": "The most commonly used in-situ test is vane shear. Hence the answer can not be either a and b."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "What is the parameter that is noted down after the completion of the vane shear test?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Shear strength",
        "b": "Angle of shear",
        "c": "Angle of twist",
        "d": "Sensitivity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Shear strength is the result obtained from the vane shear experiment.",
        "b": "In vane shear test angle of shear parameter is not used.",
        "c": "In this test vane is inserted to soil and rotated at constant speed until a pointer indicating angle of twist rotates backwards. Then the angle of twist is noted down.",
        "d": "From vane shear test sensitivity can be determined."

      "question": "If the sensitivity of clay lies between 4-8 it is classified as ________ .",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Insensitive clays",
        "b": "Quick clays",
        "c": "Very sensitive clays",
        "d": "Non sensitive clays"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "For insensitive clay the value of sensitivity is 1.",
        "b": "If the value of sensitivity ranges between 8 - 64 then it is considered as quick clay.",
        "c": "If the value of sensitivity ranges between 4 - 8 then it is considered as very sensitive clay.",
        "d": "Soils generally have sensitivity values of 1 or greater than 1. The sensitivity value less than 1 is considered as non sensitive clay."

      "question": "The minimum depth of penetration of the top of the vane from the top surface of soil is ________ .",

        "a": "10cm",
        "b": "12mm",
        "c": "1.5cm",
        "d": "10mm"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The penetration of vane on the top surface of  soil should be minimum. It should not go up to 10cm.",
        "b": "The penetration of the vane on the top surface of  soil should be minimum. It should not go up to 12mm.",
        "c": "The penetration should not be 1.5cm.",
        "d": "The penetration of the vane should be minimum, it should not go deeper into the soil. It should be 10mm."

        "c": "Rigidity",
        "d": "Consolidation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Vane shear test is used to determine the shear strength of soil.",
        "b": "Compressive strength of soil can be determined by Triaxial or Unconfined compression test.",
        "c": "Rigidity of soil is determined by oedometer and direct shear test.",
        "d": " Consolidation of soil can be determined by consolidation test."
